A dataset has a particular type which indicates the type of data
which is being, or has been observed by a specific platform. This 
can be simple scalar types (`count`, `boolean`,`double`, `text`)
or more complex types like `profile` or other `record` data being
observed over time or along a track. The default dataset type is 
`measurement` which actually is a numeric observation over time.

A resource can be filtered by dataset type(s).
